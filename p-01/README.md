The next 30min to 1hr is essentially an Angular tutorial. After the tutorial, the project will resume.

Open client/index.html and client/index.js. Place files side by side so students can see how they interact.

The HTML file uses Twitter Bootstrap. Go to http://getbootstrap.com/css/ and explain how TB works, its grid system. Show them how TB is used in our code.

Review some basic HTML tags: H1 to H6, P, A, IMG, UL/LI.

Show them how Angular works.
